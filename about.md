I am an organizer, a shaper of things, a fixer of problems, a decision maker. I like stability and structure, that is why I built it when it isnâ€™t there. I collect loose thoughts and ideas and transform them into articulated, structured concepts. I take isolated pieces of the puzzle and arrange them into full strategies with clear parts, frames, and timelines. I look at how various processes relate to each other in order to eliminate redundancies and streamline workflows. I am a focus expert. I have mastered the ability to get back on track. I plot, charter, graph, and map ideas and concepts, data, and stories so they're easier to grasp, simpler to follow and understand.

I am Project Manager, fluent in both client and programmer/data scientist, and designer. I am also fluent in English and Spanish, I am learning French. I am a Communications Strategist and Political Consultant. I design and build briefs, presentations, and a variety of reports. I create and orchestrate communication campaigns from end-to-end based on sound research, data and facts.

I am energetic, responsible, self-motivated, and a self-starter. I can be a leader and a team player. I have great organizing and sorting skills. I am an effective multi-tasker, capable of handling multiple projects at once and deliver on time and within budget.

I bring expertise in Word, Excel, Power Point, and its G Suite and Mac equivalents. I bring sufficient knowledge of Illustrator and InDesign. I am a Data Scientist in training, currently mastering R, R Studio, Tableau, SQL, and git; I will learn Python. I have degrees in Communications and Political Sociology.

I am believer in diversity and plurality. I welcome new ideas and concepts. I value structure, punctuality, and the respect for people's time. I value learning environments and purposeful curiosity. I care about respect and being valued. I care about a well kept work-life balance tipped in the right direction: that is life.

I like the cold. I like mountains, being near them, running or climbing them. I love small, well-connected, walkable, people-friendly cities. I am a localist. I am certain that big structures become disconnected with its users and its people. I believe in people, in communities. I am convinced that we still have time and there is still hope. I am a proponent of devolution, the dismantling of big-everything, in order to refocus people at the centre of societies.
